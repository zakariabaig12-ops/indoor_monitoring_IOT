# Indoor Environmental and Occupancy Monitoring System

This repository contains the source code for an IoT-based indoor monitoring system developed using an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi.

The system measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and detects occupancy using a PIR motion sensor. Data is processed locally and uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform over WiFi.

This project was developed as part of the IoT module.
